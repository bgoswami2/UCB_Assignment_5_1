Problem statement:
Determine if and what users would accept different types of coupons, if the coupons were given out for different types of products (Bar, Restaurants etc.) to different users with varying age, income, gender and other characteristics. The goal is to find patterns in the users' acceptance of these coupons and come up with a summary of observations, next steps and recommendations for what might make the marketing campaign even more effective.  

Summary of observations:
 - These coupons are accepted 100% of the time, when a coupon with 1 day or longer is given to a male driver aged between 46-50yrs, with income $50000 − $62499, and between 2PM-10PM of the day
 - However, the acceptange rate is significantly low (just over 40%) for all other drivers.
 - The acceptance rate is also very high (~96%) for all other male drivers except those between 46-50yrs old, with income $50000−$62499, if the coupons with 1day or longer expiration is given between 2PM-10PM of the day.


Next steps:
 - Further analysis should be done to interstand acceptance rates for destination, weather, marital status, passenger etc.

Recommendations:
 - Age and Income do not seem to be playing a significant role in difference in acceptance rate for this coupon. So, may be those can be removed or lowered in priority
 - The time slots are much higher (3-4hrs slots), which should be more granular to understand if there are better time of day to target drivers for higher acceptance within lower timeframe.
